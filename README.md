# BluestacksServiceManager
Prevent BlueStacks services from running in the background.

The BlueStacks Service Manager stops the BlueStacks background processes from running in the background when the app runner isn't open, freeing up your system resources. This makes your system and other programs run smoother. It can also reduce lag and allow your other programs to run as if BlueStacks wasn't even installed.
